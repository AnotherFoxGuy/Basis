## What is Basis?

If you’re here, you probably have some familiarity with VR, whether as a user or a creator. In simple terms, Basis is:

- A **set of libraries** designed to help creators bootstrap their VR projects.  
- A **reference implementation** that demonstrates how these components can work together.  
- A **starting point** for game developers who may feel overwhelmed by the technical demands of VR but have the vision to create something extraordinary with the right tools.  

The idea behind Basis is that a rising tide lifts all ships. By providing a foundation to support VR projects, it allows creators to focus on their strengths while minimizing the impact of their weaknesses. 

But to understand Basis fully, it’s equally important to define what it is *not*.

## What isn’t Basis?

Basis is **not** a platform. While it provides a robust set of tools and a clear starting point, it intentionally avoids the features typically associated with platforms:

- **No In-App Purchases or Freemium Features**: Basis isn’t designed for monetization. You won’t find support for in-app purchases, virtual economies, or paid content distribution.  
- **No Centralized Social Layer**: There’s no global network, matchmaking, or pre-built social system. Projects using Basis are entirely self-hosted.  
- **No Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Basis doesn’t include upload services for sharing avatars or worlds. These logistics are left to individual creators.  

This “anti-platform” stance isn’t driven by hostility toward these features but is instead a deliberate design choice. Building and maintaining centralized features requires first-party financial and technical support. If done poorly, these features would burden the project with maintenance issues. If done well, they’d likely be closed off and monetized—defeating the purpose of Basis as an open toolset to empower creators.  

## Is this just VRChat under a different name?

No, and it’s important to clarify why.

Basis has a deep appreciation for VRChat and similar platforms. These platforms provide invaluable social infrastructure through marketing, moderation, safety, and community-building efforts. These efforts extend far beyond the technical foundation of embodiment, presence, and spatialization—the building blocks of VR experiences.  

Basis focuses on that foundation. It deliberately avoids the additional responsibilities of creating or maintaining a social network. There is no current plan for the core Basis project to provide **any** social infrastructure, such as matchmaking, content moderation, or monetization systems. Those elements fall outside its scope.  

## But isn’t this basically a “do-it-yourself” VRChat replacement?

Some might see Basis as a starting point for building a platform-like project. However, let’s be clear: Basis is not a shortcut to competing with established platforms like VRChat. Building and maintaining a successful platform is an immense undertaking, requiring years of development, infrastructure, and user trust.  

While it’s true that Basis could theoretically serve as a fallback in a “social VR dark age” (e.g., if major platforms disappeared), its focus is on **constructive creativity, not reactionary goals**. It cannot last if its sole purpose is as a hedge against other platforms, rather than a way to empower creators to explore new ideas and directions.  

In the end, Basis is about flexibility and agency. It provides the tools and leaves the rest to creators. With Basis, you are free to take full control of your project—but with that freedom comes the responsibility to manage and maintain your own implementations.  

## Why so many words to say you're not VRChat?

Because it's come up, from both disgruntled players and creators, as well as from hesitant or concerned professionals, it is necessary to confront directly.

## The Bottom Line

Basis is *not* a competitor to VRChat or any other platform. It is a framework—a seed—designed to give creators a foundation on which to grow their own ideas. It’s not here to replicate existing ecosystems but to open new doors for exploration, experimentation, and innovation.  

## But wait, there is clearly evidence of some features that look rather social!

This is a bit more nuanced and might not be immediately obvious. Adjacent to Embodiment, Presence, and Spatialization is the concept of "Identity." Let’s break these terms down:  

- **Presence**: The feeling, based on your passive senses, that you exist in a space.  
- **Spatialization**: The feeling that phenomena (especially your actions) exist in, and have an active effect on, objects in physical space.  
- **Embodiment**: The association between a representation of a body and the real body itself, created by continuous feedback between action and reaction within a physical body.  
- **Identity**: The ability to maintain a consistent representation of yourself that can be shared with and perceived by others.  

A key component of existing in a VR space where you expect to interact with others (e.g., a four-player co-op game) is having a name and an avatar (or avatars) that you can carry with you across experiences.  

By far the easiest way to represent this is through a centralized infrastructure and API where users log in and upload an avatar. While pragmatic, this approach ties identity to centralization. Decentralized solutions—like those seen in BlueSky or Mastodon—aim to decouple identity from centralized login systems, and are worthy of research.  

This is an area of active investigation by a working group of people associated with the project, but this work is not contained within Basis itself.

## I come from the future. You lied!

This is an open project. Sometimes, things change. The principles of the project may be reinterpreted, or shift according to contributions from motivated developers and artists. If you want to participate in the conversation, join our discord and get involved!
